For each section, consider including:

Explanations of concepts
Code examples
Best practices
Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
Comparisons with alternative approaches where relevant

Additionally, you might want to create a set of reusable components or utility functions that demonstrate these concepts, which could include:

A basic CRUD component that works with your chosen database
An authentication HOC (Higher Order Component) for protecting routes
A data fetching wrapper that handles loading and error states
A form component with validation and submission handling
A layout component that includes navigation and footer

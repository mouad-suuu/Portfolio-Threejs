This structure consolidates related topics into broader sections, making it easier to navigate and understand the relationships between different aspects of Next.js 14. Each main section can be a separate DocumentationSection in your TypeScript interface, with subsections represented as nested items.

Would you like me to start providing content for these reorganized sections?
